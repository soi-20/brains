```
Learn from times iterated over time spent.

Craft a thousand tweets before ten blog posts before one novel.

Skim a dozen books before absorbing one.

Make many small investments before a few big bets.

Build many small products before starting a company.

Explore, then exploit.
```

The compound interest from many quick small iterations is greater than the compound interest from a few slow big iterations. Compound interest operates in most intellectual and social domains.

Intellectual and social domains tend towards nonlinear outcomes. It's more important to find nonlinear upside than it is to try and improve an existing linear situation.

But not all iterations are compounding in nature. Playing the lottery every day doesn't compound. You're just as likely to win on day 1 or 1000.

Pivoting without learning doesn't compound.Introspection without action doesn't compound. A random walk doesn't compound.

Compounding iteration needs every step to benefit from previous experience. It needs a healthy learning loop and incredibly consistent recall.

It's why not everyone who reads 1000 books is a genius.It's why not every "repeat entrepreneur" is a billionaire.
