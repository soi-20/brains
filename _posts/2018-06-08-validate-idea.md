# Principles

First, go speak with potential users and try to pre-sell your product or service. Focus on problems, not solutions. Get some feedbacks(the REAL Idea)from them.

So, how to validate the idea?

Usually founders will be like:

The best team will be like:

In MVP you launch the first version of your product with sufficient features, but not all, to early adopters so that you can get feedback from them. MVP and the "Build Measure Learn" feedback loop, gives you important tools to leverage your product. 

Build something you can measure and iterate.

# Rules

## Where

Often what you create will initially seem to fit into an existing market, but with less functionality. With the fullness of  time, it will become obvious that the job your customers are hiring you for is completely different than the “incumbents” -David Rusenko 

## When 

“Launch when your product is better than what’s out there.” - Paul Buchheit

## What

“The true test of Product-Market Fit iss 'drowning in demand'.” - Michael Seibel

### Focus on problems not solution
 
Write down the problem you're trying to solve and your solution. A lot of ideas may sound awesome while they're in your head, but that might change once you transform it from an abstract concept into 2–3 sentences.

Talk to users, develop a market thesis. Make sure to ask questions relevant to judging whether your idea might take off, such as "How often are you facing this problem" rather than "Have you ever faced this problem". 

### Identify people in your target audience

This is hard. Don't simply email the survey link to your friends - because of something called "Interviewer bias", your friends will rate your ideas more favorably than the general public. Also, it's highly likely that your friends aren't actually in your target audience.

### Distill your entire product down to 1–2 features

Your first version should be a feature instead of a product. Figure out what 1 feature summarizes the entire product.

### Aggressively market the heck out of it for 3 months

Building a fully functional product is the most expensive possible way to test your hypothesis. 

Focus on getting to a functional prototype as quickly as possible that you can get in front of users. 

### Ask yourself

Were you able to get 100 users who insanely love your product? Are people coming back to use the product again? Are your users enthusiastic? After 3 months, you should have some basic feeling on whether this thing is gonna float or not.
