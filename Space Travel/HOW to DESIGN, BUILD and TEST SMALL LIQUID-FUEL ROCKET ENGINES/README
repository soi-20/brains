Wecome to the tarball version of the book:
HOW to DESIGN, BUILD and TEST SMALL LIQUID-FUEL ROCKET ENGINES

I want to put this book on the W3 for people to read and use.  The
book has been out-of-print for some time now and is hard to find.  I
have a photocopy of a photocopy that I scanned and processed with
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software.  (Omnipage Pro)

Unfortunately, as anyone who has used OCR systems knows, the
conversion of bitmap to text is not from perfect, especially if the
original text is hard to read (such as a second-generation photocopy).
Before converting the text to HTML, these errors were edited out by
human beings, who are also prone to error.  Reader beware.

As a unix person, I don't know how this will look if untarred under
Dos, Windows, MacOS, AmigaDOS, CP/M, VMS, MVS, or any other operating
system.  Your milage may vary.  

The file index.html is the start point, although it is just a symbolic
link to book.html, which is the real top.
